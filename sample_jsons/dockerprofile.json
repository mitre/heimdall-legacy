A user added to the\ndocker group\n    gives him full root access rights.\n    Docker allows you to share a directory between the Docker host and a guest\ncontainer\n    without limiting the access rights of the container. This means that you\ncan start a\n    container and map the / directory on your host to the container. The\ncontainer will then be\n    able to alter your host file system without any restrictions. In simple\nterms, it means that\n    you can attain elevated privileges with just being a member of the docker\ngroup and then\n    starting a container with mapped / directory on the host.\n\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"ref\": \"1.\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attacksurface\\n2.\nhttps://www.andreas-jung.com/contents/on-docker-security-docker-groupconsidered-harmful\\n3.\nhttp://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-rundocker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel/\\n\"\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"cis_id\": \"1.4\"\n  tag \"cis_control\": \"5.1 Minimize And Sparingly Use Administrative\nPrivileges\\n\"\n  tag \"cis_level\": \"Level 1 - Linux Host OS\"\n  tag \"nist\": [\"AC-6 (9)\"]\n  tag \"audit\": \"Execute the below command on the docker host and ensure that\nonly trusted users are\\nmembers of the docker group.\\ngetent group docker\\n\"\n  tag \"fix\": \"Remove any users from the docker group that are not trusted.\nAdditionally, do not create a\\nmapping of sensitive directories on host to\ncontainer volumes.\\n\"\n  tag \"Default Value\": \"Not Applicable\\n\"\nend\n","source_location":{"ref":"./controls/M-1.4.rb","line":1},"id":"M-1.4"},{"title":"1.5 Ensure auditing is configured for the docker daemon (Scored)","desc":"Audit all Docker daemon activities.\n    Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit\nDocker daemon\n    as well.
